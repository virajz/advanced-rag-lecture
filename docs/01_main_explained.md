# main.py - The Entry Point

## What is this file?

This is the **simplest file** in the project. It's like the "front door" of the application.

## The Code (6 lines!)

```python
def main():
    print("Hello from advanced-rag-lecture!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explained Like You're 5

Imagine you have a toy box (this project). This file is like the label on the box that says "Open me first!"

When you run this file directly, it just says "Hello!" to let you know the project is working.

## Breaking It Down

| Line | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `def main():` | Creates a function (a reusable recipe) called "main" |
| `print("Hello...")` | Shows a message on your screen |
| `if __name__ == "__main__":` | "Only do this if someone runs THIS file directly" |
| `main()` | Actually runs the recipe we defined |

## Why Does This Exist?

It's a **placeholder** or starting point. In a real project, this would probably call the actual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## How to Run It

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see: `Hello from advanced-rag-lecture!`

*This is the simplest file - the real magic happens in the other files!*
